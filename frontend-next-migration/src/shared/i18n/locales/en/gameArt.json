  "info-label": "What is Game Art?",
  "info-description": "“At its best, game art gives its experiencer great freedom to explore and experiment with different histories and futures, the direction of which even the game's creators have not precisely defined. Game art offers sensory pleasures. Additionally, it can act as a conversation starter and a tool for growing wisdom and strengthening emotional life.” Jaakko Kemppainen, Game Designer's Basic Book (2019) and 100 Game Ideas (2022). https://taidetutka.fi/2022/moniulotteinen-pelitaide/",

It invites players deeper into the experience, offering unique artistic and aesthetic delights. Game art not only entertains but challenges, evokes emotions, and provides an opportunity to reflect on various themes. Game art can manifest in many ways; it may be visually stunning graphics, atmospheric soundscapes, or complex storytelling. Art games can also utilize game mechanics and interaction between the player and the game to create unique experiences. One of the most important features of game art is its ability to tell stories.",

Through games, a wide range of themes can be addressed, such as love, loss, survival, identity, social injustices, and much more. Games can provide players with the opportunity to experience and understand these topics deeply, making game art a powerful tool for storytelling and creating meaning.",
