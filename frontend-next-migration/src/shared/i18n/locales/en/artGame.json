  "info-description": "“At its best, game art gives the experiencer great freedom to explore and experiment with different histories and futures, the direction of which even the game creators have not precisely defined. Game art offers sensory pleasures. In addition, it can serve as a conversation starter and a tool for wisdom growth and emotional strengthening.” Jaakko Kemppainen, Game Designer's Handbook (2019) and 100 Game Ideas (2022). <br> https://taidetutka.fi/2022/multidimensional-game-art/",

One of the most important features of game art is its ability to tell stories.",
