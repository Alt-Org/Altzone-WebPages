    "text1":"ALT Zone is a mobile game with artistic content, which is being developed as a teaching tool for art education in elementary schools. Just as the teaching of literature in schools begins with reading a common book, analyzing it and creating meaning to promote the understanding of literature, ALT Zone provides a similar common ground for the teaching of the art of play in elementary schools. In the game, it is possible to analyze the game art without playing the game, with the help of videos, pictures and series of questions. While playing the game deepens the experience, it is not necessary for teaching. This makes the package as easy as possible for the teacher.",
    "text2":"Teaching the art of acting is challenging because it is not possible to reach a common ground, such as shared experience of the same play. Therefore, teaching game analysis and game art thinking in schools is difficult without a common language. Although different games can be analyzed, learning never reaches the meaning-making and understanding offered by art education, where experiences are shared together.",
    "text3":"Finally, the students further develop the game, resulting in the ALT Zone 2.0 mobile game, which anyone can download from the app store. The proceeds of the 2.0 game are used to support the dreams of young people through the foundation."
