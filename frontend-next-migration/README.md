This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Setting Up the Project

To open the project, I recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/).

### Working with GitHub Desktop

In GitHub Desktop, make sure to select the `dev` branch.  
Afterward, open the `dev` branch in Visual Studio Code (or your preferred IDE).

Once the branch is open in your IDE, add the `.env` file you received to the root directory.

### Running the Development Server

Now, to start the development server, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
