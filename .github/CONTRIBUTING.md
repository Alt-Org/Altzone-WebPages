### 🛠️ Making Changes

#### Making Changes Locally

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   If you're new to GitHub, follow these steps to [fork the project](https://github.com/Alt-Org/Altzone-WebPages/wiki/Getting-Started). This allows you to work on your own copy without affecting the main project.

2. **Create a Working Branch**  
   Make sure to create a new branch for your changes. For more information on branching strategies, see our [Branching Guide](https://github.com/Alt-Org/Altzone-WebPages/wiki/Branching).

3. **Start Working**  
   Begin making your changes locally on your working branch. Make sure to follow the project's coding standards and best practices.

4. **Commit Your Changes**  
   Once you’ve made your changes, commit them with a clear and descriptive message summarizing the update.

### 📤 Pull Requests

When you're ready to submit your work, you can open a Pull Request (PR). Here's how:

1. **Create a Pull Request**  
   Submit a PR to merge your branch into the main project. Follow the guidelines laid out in our [Pull Request Guide](https://github.com/Alt-Org/Altzone-WebPages/wiki/Pull-Request). Be sure to include a meaningful title and description.

2. **Link Your PR to an Issue**  
   If your PR resolves an open issue, make sure to link the PR to that issue. This helps the community track progress.

3. **Review Process**  
   Your PR will be reviewed by a team member. They may ask for clarifications, suggest changes, or request more details. Be open to feedback and make the necessary adjustments.
